This is a Readme broski!

By the way if a Year has past and you still see this please remind me to update my README to make them more user friendly.
understand I am still a student and to limit the my attention to thingss that relevent to learning I tend to cut out anything I deem unecesarry at the time. That being the case it does not mean I find README's to be unimportant. It is a case of me looking more to focus my time on the things I deem to be important to learning. You can sharpen a pencil but can you solve the equation.
